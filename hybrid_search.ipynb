    "1. Semantic Search: This is a search technique that uses embeddings to understand the context and meaning of the query and documents. It goes beyond simple keyword matching by capturing the semantic meaning of the text.\n",

These vectors typically represent data points in a continuous vector space, such as word embeddings, image features, or other types of embeddings generated by neural networks.
